# Tigerhacks 2023: Movie Star Simulator!
 
## By Cole Jones, Jonathan Gutierrez, and Maggie Hilty

### How to play

Movie Star Simulator (MSS for short) is a terminal-based game written entirely in C.  
In order to play MSS, you'll need to:  

1. Download all necessary files
2. Compile and run 

### Our development process

We started by brainstorming ideas for our project.  
Some ideas we had included:

1. A Buzzfeed quiz -esque game to determine what movie you should watch next
2. Snake
3. A choose your own adventure game

We decided that #3 would be the most challenging (but still feasible) and  
entertaining project. 

Our development process was bottom-up: we began by creating functions we  
knew we would probably need, then using these functions, we began building  
larger functions to call in our main().

### What we learned

Some of the things we learned from this project were:

1. The basics of implementing a terminal-based choose your own adventure game
2. Color-coding in a terminal
3. Creating our own Abstract Data Type and using it to simplify functions
4. Randomizing integers in C
5. Using a github repository to collaborate

We also talked to a mentor, Matthew Marlow, about streamlining the final  
project and how to submit it. Thanks, Matt!  

### Things we struggled with and possible improvements

We struggled with making multiple random integers at once, as well as using scanf  
while checking for valid input. We found ways to work around these issues,  
but there are likely better ones that we just don't know yet.  

Our organization is not that great, and in the future, it might be a better  
idea to have each function (or small group of functions) in its own file,  
rather than have each function in one or two files total. 

Using C was a challenge, and it helped us realize the convenience of object  
oriented languages. However, it was still fun and rewarding.
